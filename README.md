# UFOS
This was indeed a difficult challenge, and one, that at the end, I was unable to completely execute.  I received assistance from the tutor, the TA's and was able to write the for-loop code to go through each filter.  The code had no errors, but when I ran the Website, the filters did not function as expected.  Nevertheless, I learned much about JavaScript, and it is a language that I wish to improve upon.

The techology used was:
- VSCode for editing the index.html and app.js files, as well as the script.css file
- JavaScript
- Html
- CSS with Bootstrap enhancements

The purpose of the project was to develop a workable webpage that would allow users to manipulate several filters to select data from a table and thus learn more about the veracity of UFO sightings. 

While I did not do as well in this assignment as in previous ones, I am not discouraged and will continue to learn more about Website design and how to use the interactive power of JavaScript to allow for powerful Web applications.
